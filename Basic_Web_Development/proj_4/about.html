      <h4>FINE COCOA EXPERT</h4>
      <p>Very few chocolatiers go so far as to become growers. But in order to learn more about cocoa, oversee its quality, and guarantee its refinement, Valrhona has mastered all aspects of the industry. It is in that spirit that Valrhona decided to open and operate its own plantations, first in Venezuela, and more recently, in the Dominican Republic.</p>
