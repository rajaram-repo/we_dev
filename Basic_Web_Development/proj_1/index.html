			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<br />
			<p>Montreal(officially Montr&eacute;al) is the most populous municipality in the province of Quebec and the second-most populous in Canada.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Originally called Ville-Marie, or "City of Mary", it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city</p>
			<br />
			<p>The city of Montreal occupies about three-fourths of Montreal Island (&Icirc;le de Montr&eacute;al)</p>
			<br />
			<p>In 2016 the city had a population of 1,704,694. Montreal's metropolitan area had a population of 4,098,927 and a population of 1,942,044 in the urban agglomeration, with all of the municipalities on the Island of Montreal included.</p>
			<br />
			<p>French is the city's official language and is the language spoken at home by 49.8% of the population of the city, followed by English at 22.8% and 18.3% other languages (in the 2016 census, not including multi-language responses).</p>
			<br />
			<h3>A festival city beyond compare!</h3>
			<br />
			<p>No matter the season, time or weather, we Montrealers flock to festivals like moths to a flame.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Relaxed, safe and friendly, it's just a plain old good time where masses of people of all backgrounds and origins come together to create, experience and share Montr&eacute;al's truly unique festival vibe.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Major festivals include the Festival International de Jazz de Montr&eacute;al, the Just for Laughs comedy festival and the FrancoFolies, to name but a few.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Other equally popular summer crowd-pleasers include the elite Formula 1 Grand Prix du Canada and the explosive International des Feux Loto-Qu&eacute;bec, a fireworks competition that lights up the Montr&eacute;al night skies all summer long.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Our festival fervour continues through the winter with the MONTR&Eacute;AL EN LUMI&Egrave;RE festival, a celebration of food, arts and music which warms the soul in chilly temperatures.</p>
