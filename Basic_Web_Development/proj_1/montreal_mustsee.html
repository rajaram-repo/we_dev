			<img src="saint-paul.jpg" alt="Rue saint-paul" />
			<p>Montreal's oldest street is Rue Saint-Paul, paved in cobblestones and home to many historic buildings such as the Bonsecours Market.</p>

			<h3>Parc du Mont-Royal</h3>
			<img src="mount-royal-park.jpg" alt="Parc du Mont-Royal" />
			<p>This 761-foot hill from which Montreal got its name is the largest of the city's parks. Towering over central Montreal (and accessible from the Green Line's Peel m&eacute;tro station or the Orange Line's Mont-Royal m&eacute;tro station), Parc du Mont-Royal is frequented by joggers, picnickers, dog walkers and bicyclists throughout the year. During the warmer months, you can rent row boats to take on the park's Lac des Castors (Beaver Lake), while the Chalet du Mont-Royal offers breathtaking park and city views any time of year. Also, be sure to stop by the Croix du Mont-Royal (Mont-Royal Cross), or the park's two cemeteries (one English and one French).<br />
Recent visitors highly recommended walking up the stairs to the top of the hill for an unbeatable view of the city but warn that it's a steep trek.

			<h3>Jean-Talon Market</h3>
			<img src="Jean-Talon.jpg" alt="Jean-Talon Market" />
			<p>Jean-Talon Market
In a world dominated by overly refrigerated, fluorescently lit supermarkets, the Jean-Talon Market is literally a breath of fresh air and one of the largest public markets in North America. Located a block or so off Boulevard Saint-Laurent (accessible from the Blue Line's De Castelnau m&eacute;tro station), this open-air market entices with the aromas of grilled sausages, Quebecois cheeses, mounds of fresh produce, home-grown spices and handmade chocolates. Even if you're not looking to buy, recent visitors recommend that you take a stroll through the market to meet and mingle with Montrealers.

The market is open daily, but hours vary by the day of the week; check the website before you go for more information.</p>
			<br />
			<h3>La Ronde</h3>
			<img src="laronde.jpg" alt="La Ronde" />
			<p>This beloved amusement park on Ile Sainte-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne - originally constructed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition (Expo 67) and now a Six Flags facility - is the largest in Eastern Canada and a great way to spend a day if you are traveling as a family. From stomach-churning roller coasters to the toddler-friendly Le Galopant carousel, La Ronde has something for visitors of all ages. It's also worth a return visit, as new attractions are constantly being built. Plus the park plays host to numerous special events, one of the most popular being l'International des Feux d'Artifice (International Fireworks), a bi-weekly event held throughout July during which representatives from different countries compete in a fireworks competition.

Recent visitors recommended arriving early during the summer to avoid having to park far from the entrance and waiting in long lines.</p>
