		<h1>Art &amp; Architecture</h1>
		<br />
		<p>Classic European art and architectural influences meet with an urbane, design-heavy aesthetic in Montr&eacute;al and Qu&eacute;bec City. Here are some art highlights.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Bruce Price &amp; Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac</h3>
		<img src="chateau.jpg" alt="Bruce Price and chateau Frontenac" />
		<p>It is an American architect, Bruce Price (1845-1903), who is responsible for the most iconic building in the entire province of Qu&eacute;bec: Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac, Qu&eacute;bec City's visual center."The Ch&acirc;teau" opened as a hotel in 1893, and with its castlelike architecture, soaring turrets, and romantic French-Renaissance mystery, it achieved its goal of becoming the most talked-about accommodation in North America. Today this high-end property is managed by the Fairmont chain.<br />
The Ch&acirc;teau was one of many similar-styled hotels commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th century during construction of Canada's first transcontinental railway. As part of the same Canadian Pacific Railway project, Price also designed Montr&eacute;al's Windsor Station; the Dalhousie Station in Montr&eacute;al; the facade of Royal Victoria College in Montr&eacute;al; and the Gare du Palais train station in Qu&eacute;bec City, whose turrets echo those of the Ch&acirc;teau Frontenac. As the leading practitioner of the ch&acirc;teau style, Price is sometimes credited with having made it the national look of Canada.</p>

		<h3>Church architecture</h3>
		<img src="Church-Montreal.jpg" alt="Church Architecture" />
		<p>Founded as a Roman Catholic French colony and nicknamed "la ville aux cent clochers" (the city of a hundred belltowers), Montreal is renowned for its churches.<br />
The city has four Roman Catholic basilicas: Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, Notre-Dame Basilica, St. Patrick's Basilica, and Saint Joseph's Oratory. The Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the largest dome of its kind in the world after that of Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. Other well-known churches include Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours Chapel, which is sometimes called the Sailors' Church.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Skyscrapers</h3>
		<img src="skyline.jpg" alt="Skyscrapers" />
		<p>Skyscraper construction in Montreal has swung between periods of intense activity and prolonged lulls. A two-year period from 1962 to 1964 saw the completion of four of Montreal's ten tallest buildings: Tour de la Bourse, I. M. Pei's landmark cruciform Place Ville-Marie, the CIBC Building and CIL House. Its tallest buildings, the 51-storey 1000 de La Gaucheti&egrave;re and the 47-storey 1250 Ren&eacute;-L&eacute;vesque, were both completed in 1992.<br/>
Montreal places height-limits on skyscrapers so that they do not exceed the height of Mount Royal. The city forbids any building from reaching an elevation higher than or 223 metres above mean sea level. Above-ground height is further limited in most areas and only a few downtown land plots are allowed to exceed 120 metres in height. The limit is currently attained by 1000 de La Gaucheti&egrave;re and 1250 Ren&eacute;-L&eacute;vesque, the latter of which is shorter, but built on higher ground. The only way to reach higher than 1000 de La Gaucheti&egrave;re while respecting this limit would be to build on the lowest part of downtown near Tour de la Bourse; the maximum height there would be approximately 210 metres.</p>

		<h3>Montreal Metro</h3>
		<img src="metro.jpg" alt="Montreal Metro" />
		<p>In terms of modern architecture, the Montreal Metro is filled with a profusion of public artwork by some of the biggest names in Quebec culture. In addition, the design and ornamentation of each station in the Metro system is unique, much like the Stockholm Metro and the Moscow Metro.In terms of modern architecture, the Montreal Metro is filled with a profusion of public artwork by some of the biggest names in Quebec culture.

		<h3>Mus&eacute;e d'Art Contemporain de Montr&eacute;al</h3>
		<img src="contemporain.jpg" alt="Musae d'art Contemporain de Montreal" />
		<p>Founded in the early 1960s and housed in a modernist temple of glass, the Mus&eacute;e d'Art Contemporain de Montr&eacute;al holds the torch for 20th- and 21th-century artistic expression. It also offers a terrific restaurant, Le Contemporain, to which one can repair after the surfeit of works by an international array of talents, from James Turrell to Vik Muniz to Claude </p>
		<br />
		<h3>Montreal Museum of Fine Arts</h3>
		<img src="montreal-museum.jpg" alt="Montreal Museum of Fine Arts" />
		<p>Spread across various buildings and wings erected over the course of more than a century, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts is home to a number of mind-expanding galleries. Among them is an areamontreal-museum devoted to 20th-century Canadian Abstract Expressionists as well as a decorative-arts pavilion that spans eons of style, all spread across several open levels knitted together by terrazzo ramps and stairways.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Other notable structures</h3>
		<br />
		<p>Other significant works of modern architecture in Montreal include the Brutalist Place Bonaventure, the world's largest building when it was completed in 1968, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Westmount Square and Roger Taillibert's controversial Olympic Stadium, which incorporates the world's tallest inclined tower, at 175 metres.</p>
		<br />
		<p>In 2006, the city was recognized by the international design community as a UNESCO City of Design, one of the three world design capitals.</p>
